# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, I am loading data from a csv file into pgAdmin, cleaning the data, answering questions using queries, and coming up with my own questions.
My goal is to understand the data well, clean it, and be able to extract meaningful data from the dataset to answer the questions I have.

## Process
I imported data from csv files into the database tables I created.

Then, I looked at some questions I have about the dataset and cleaned the data based on the questions I had.

Lastly I answered the questions using queries.

## Results
After analyzing the data I was able to get meaningful information from it such as information about different products that were ordered, 
the most expensive and least expensive products, the total amount of page views per year, the countries and cities with the highest level of transaction revenues and so on.

## Challenges 
Linking the tables together as most tables didnt have any unique identifiers. Dealing with inconsistant formatting.

## Future Goals
I would add more columns to the tables and ensure all tables are linked in a way and Create more tables to store the data.
