# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
In this project, I am loading data from a csv file into pgAdmin, cleaning the data, answering questions using queries, and coming up with my own questions.
My goal is to understand the data well, clean it, and be able to extract meaningful data from the dataset to answer the questions I have.
## Process
### (your step 1)
I imported data from csv files into the database tables I created. Then I looked at some questions I have aboutt the dataset and cleaned the data based on the questions I had. Next I answered the questions using queries.
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Linking the tables together as most tables didnt have any unique identifiers. Dealing with inconsistant formatting
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

I would add more columns to the tables and ensure all tables are linked in a way. Create more tables.
